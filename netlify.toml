# Secrets Scanning Configuration
# VITE_ prefixed variables are client-side by design and will appear in build output
# This is expected behavior for Vite applications - these variables are meant to be public
# 
# To fix secrets scanning errors, set these environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
# (Site settings → Environment variables → Add variable)
#
# Option 1: Disable secrets scanning entirely (recommended for Vite apps)
#   SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED = false
#
# Option 2: Omit specific keys and paths from scanning
